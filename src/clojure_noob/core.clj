;; or it will return nil if the key is not found:

(inventors "Foo")  ; nil

;; any Clojure data structure can be a key in a map
;; The fact that keywords resolve to themselves makes keywords useful as keys.

;; Keywords are also functions. They take a map argument and look themselves up in the map.
(:b mymap) ;; "boring example"

;; we can also use get to lookup from map

(get mymap :a)
((get mymap "d") 2 3) ;5
(get mymap "c" "not found") ; get can provide default value if not found
